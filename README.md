# Task
* You have been tasked with designing a complex UI for a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Your UI should include the following components:

* A Bootstrap-based header with a responsive navigation bar. The navigation bar should include a heading, links to different sections of the website, and a search bar. The navigation bar should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
* Below the header, a Bootstrap carousel should be implemented to showcase multiple images with captions and calls-to-action. The carousel should have indicators and controls, and it should transition smoothly between slides.
* Next, create a custom CSS section with a flex div. The flex div should have three divs inside of it. Each div should contain an image and a short description.
* After the custom flex section, implement a photo gallery using CSS Grid. The photo gallery should have 3 rows and 3 columns, displaying a total of 9 images. Use public images from websites like Unsplash or Pexels. The images should be responsive and maintain their aspect ratios. The grid should look like the one in the ui given.
* Add a Bootstrap card section, displaying three cards with an image, title, description, and a call-to-action button. The cards should have a slight drop shadow, and the buttons should have a smooth hover effect. the cards should go from being shown in a row to a column as screen size becomes small.
* Lastly, include a Bootstrap footer with various links, a copyright statement, and a back-to-top button.
* Your UI should be responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. You should also ensure that your code is well-organized, properly commented, and follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Use any images you want, and you are even allowed to edit the text content wherever you want.
